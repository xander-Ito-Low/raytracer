# raytracer
A ray tracer that accommodates photon mapping, defocus blur, and caustics 
To run the code:

1) g++ -o lab2executable main.cpp directional_light.cpp framebuffer.cpp phong.cpp polymesh.cpp sphere.cpp camera.cpp scene.cpp  pinholeCamera.cpp triangle.cpp pointLight.cpp BoundingBox.cpp thinLens.cpp -std=c++11
2) ./lab2executable

For more details about the implementation of this ray tracer, a report is provided about the theory behind the implemented features.
